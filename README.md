## Features and Commands
The following examples use the default prefix "!!stp". Adjust according to your configuration file.

### Personal Waypoints
Players can create and manage their own waypoints, which are only visible to themselves.
- **Create Personal Waypoint**: `!!stp setp <name>`
- **Teleport to Personal Waypoint**: `!!stp tpp <name>`
- **Delete Personal Waypoint**: `!!stp delp <name>`
- **List All Personal Waypoints** (clickable for teleport): `!!stp listp`

### Global Waypoints (Public Waypoints)
Global waypoints are visible to all players and suitable for public areas.
- **Create Global Waypoint**: `!!stp setg <name>`
- **Teleport to Global Waypoint**: `!!stp tpg <name>`
- **Delete Global Waypoint**: `!!stp delg <name>`
- **List All Global Waypoints** (clickable for teleport): `!!stp listg`

### Other Commands
- **List All Waypoints** (personal and global): `!!stp list`
- **Return to Last Location**: `!!stp back` (available after teleporting or upon death)

## Configuration File
The configuration file is located at `config/SimpleTP/config.json`
- **prefix**: Command prefix, default is `!!stp`
- **back_on_death**: Whether to automatically record the position upon player death, default is `true`
- **permissions**: Permission configuration
- **worlds**: List of supported dimensions (including mod dimensions), default is `["minecraft:overworld", "minecraft:the_nether", "minecraft:the_end"]`. Teleportation will not work in dimensions not in this list. To disable teleportation in a dimension, simply remove it from the list.

### Permission Configuration
- **back**: Permission to use `!!stp back` command
- **tpa**: Permission to use `!!stp tpa` command
- **tpahere**: Permission to use `!!stp tpahere` command
- **tp**: Permission to use `!!stp tp <player>` command
- **tphere**: Permission to use `!!stp tphere <player>` command
- **tp_xyz**: Permission to use `!!stp tp <x> <y> <z>` command
- **personal_waypoint**: Permission to set/delete personal waypoint related commands
- **global_waypoint**: Permission to set/delete global waypoint related commands
- **cross_world_tp**: Permission for cross-dimension teleportation

## Dependencies
- **minecraft_data_api**: Used for retrieving player information
- **mg_events**: Used for listening to player death events

## Common Issues
- **Clickable Teleport Button Not Responding**
    MCDR has issues with click execution support in higher MC versions. Install [LetMeClickAndSendForServer](https://github.com/Fallen-Breath/LetMeClickAndSendForServer) (server-side) or [LetMeClickAndSend](https://github.com/Fallen-Breath/LetMeClickAndSend) (client-side).
- **Sometimes `back` Command Doesn't Return to Previous Location After Death**
    Some mod death messages are special and may not be detected by mg_events. You need to manually add corresponding death messages in mg_events language files. For example, for the [Eternal Starlight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/eternal-starlight) mod, when players die in the Ether, add `"death.attack.ether": "%1$s drifts away"` to `config/mg_events/lang/en_us.json`, and `"death.attack.ether": "%1$sé£˜ç„¶è€ŒåŽ»"` to `config/mg_events/lang/zh_cn.json`.
- **Log Shows "Player {player} is in a dimension not enabled in config: {dimension}"**
    This indicates the player is in a dimension not enabled in the configuration. Check the `worlds` configuration in `config/SimpleTP/config.json` to ensure the dimension is included.
